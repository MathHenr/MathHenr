Hi, I'm Matheus, a former Agricultural Engineering student at Unicamp currently transitioning into the tech world, based in Campinas.

I enjoy building clean, functional, and cohesive websites and web applications.

My main tools are React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I’ve also worked on a few small private projects in Python related to data mining during my time at university.
